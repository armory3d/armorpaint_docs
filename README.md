# Workflow

![](img/d.jpg)

#### Import Meshes

Drag and drop unwrapped `.obj` file into the viewport. This will replace the currently painted mesh. `.fbx`, `.blend`, `.stl`, `.gltf` and `.glb` files are supported, but the importer is not 100% reliable yet.

In the `Import Mesh` dialog:
- Set `Split By` combo to `UDIM Tile` to parse imported `.obj` mesh into UDIM tiles.
- Enable `Parse Transforms` to load per-object transforms from `.fbx` file.
- Enable `Parse Vertex Colors` to load vertex color data from `.fbx` or `.blend` file.

Modifying imported mesh data:
- Normals can be re-calculated with `Meshes tab - Tools... - Calculate Normals`.
- Up axis can be set with `Meshes tab - Tools... - Rotate X / Rotate Y / Rotate Z`.
- UV map can be auto-generated by enabling the `uv_unwrap` plugin.

> You can download sample assets for testing on [GitHub](https://github.com/armory3d/armorpaint_samples/releases).

> See `Menu bar - Preferences... - Plugins` to enable support for additional mesh formats.

#### Import Materials

Drag and drop a folder with PBR texture set onto the viewport. ArmorPaint will recognize the file extensions and create a new material from imported textures. Multiple folders can be dropped at once.

Click on the `Materials tab - Import` button to import materials from ArmorPaint `.arm` files or Blender `.blend` files. *wip*

> You can download starter content from [GitHub](https://github.com/armory3d/armorpaint_lib/releases). *wip*

#### Import Textures

Drag and drop `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tga`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.psd`, `.hdr` or `.tif` images into the node editor. This will import the image and place a new `Image` node onto the canvas.

> See `Menu bar - Preferences... - Plugins` to enable support for additional image formats.

#### Export Textures

Click on the `Menu bar - File - Export Textures...` button.

- `Resolution`: Set resolution for exported textures.
- `Color`: Set `8bit`, `16bit` or `32bit` color depth.
- `Format`: `.png` or `.jpg` (for `8bit` color), `.exr` (for `16bit / 32bit` color).
- `Layers`: Export all visible layers or selected layers only into textures.
- `Preset`: Select a pre-configured preset or build a custom one.
  - `Generic` preset exports individual PBR textures.
  - `Unreal` preset exports packed *occlusion-roughness-metallic* texture.
  - `Unity` preset exports packed *metallic-occlusion-smoothness* texture.
  - `Minecraft` preset exports packed *metallic-emission-roughness* texture.

Configure custom channel swizzling for exported textures in `Presets` tab:
- Select an existing preset you wish to edit or press `New`.
- Press `Import` to import preset from `.json` file.
- Press `Add` to create new texture slot.
- Configure `RGBA` channels for each texture slot.
- Right-click on texture name and press `Delete` to delete texture slot.
- `.json` file for each preset is located in the `ArmorPaint/data/presets` folder.

#### Export Mesh

Click on the `Menu bar - File - Export Mesh...` button to save the currently loaded mesh into `.obj` file. This is handy if you only have access to the `.arm` project file or want to export the mesh which has been unwrapped / modified in ArmorPaint.

#### Save / Load Project

Click on the `Menu bar - File - Save` button (`Ctrl + S`) to save the currently opened project. Mesh, layers, materials and brushes will be saved into `.arm` project file.

To open the project file, drag and drop `.arm` file onto the viewport. `.arm` files can also be set to open directly with ArmorPaint executable from the OS file explorer.

`.obj` and other asset types can also be associated if you wish to use ArmorPaint as a model / texture viewer.

#### Browser

Click on the `Status bar - Browser tab` to activate the built-in asset browser.
- Drag assets from browser into the viewport to import.
- For `.arm` materials, preview icons are displayed.
- Click on the `+` button to save the current path into bookmarks panel.

#### Plugin Development

Plugins are written in `JavaScript` or `WebAssembly` (compiled from `C`, `Rust`, ..). For a minimal example, see the [bundled](https://github.com/armory3d/armorpaint/tree/master/Assets/plugins) `hello_world.js` file located in the `Armorpaint/data/plugins` folder. A plugin development guide will be provided soon.
